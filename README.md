Perl Module Travis-CI Helper
============================
This is a set of utilities meant to aid in testing modules on travis-ci.  It
will automatically build perl if the version requested doesn't exist.

While Travis-CI provides simple testing with perl or other languages, it has
several limitations to address.  It only has a limited number of perl versions
available, and only uses the default build options.

These helpers will build perl versions for you if they aren't available.
Additional helpers will build a dist package using a newer perl than the tests
are run with, or aid with installing dependencies or reporting code coverage.

The helpers can be used individually, or _automatic mode_ can be used if using
a standard testing setup.

Example Simple .travis.yml
--------------------------

    language: perl
    perl:
      - "5.8"               # normal preinstalled perl
      - "5.8.4"             # downloads a pre-built 5.8.4
      - "5.8.4-thr"         # pre-built 5.8.4 with threading
      - "5.12.2"            # builds perl 5.12.2 from source (pre-built not available)
      - "5.20"              # installs latest perl 5.20 (if not already available)
      - "dev"               # installs latest developer release of perl (e.g. 5.21.8)
      - "blead"             # builds perl from git
    cache:
      directories:
        - $HOME/perl5
    matrix:
      include:
        - perl: 5.18
          env: COVERAGE=1   # enables coverage+coveralls reporting
      allow_failures:
        - perl: blead       # ignore failures for blead perl
    sudo: false             # faster builds as long as you don't need sudo access
    before_install:
      - eval $(curl https://travis-perl.github.io/init) --auto

This will work for most distributions.  It will work with dists using a
Makefile.PL, Build.PL, or Dist::Zilla.

Perl Building
-------------
If the specified perl version is already installed on the Travis testing
machine, it will be used as is.  Any requested perl version that isn't available
will be built for you.  Additionally, a number of commonly tested versions are
pre-built and will be automatically downloaded and used to speed up testing.
The pre-built perl versions are listed in the [.travis.yml for the builder
repo](https://github.com/travis-perl/builder/blob/master/.travis.yml).
If the patch level isn't included in the version, the latest in that series will
be used.  Additionally, some build flags can be specified by adding them as dash
separated suffixes (e.g. 5.10.1-thr-mb).

  * thr
    Builds a perl with thread support.  Controls the `useithreads` flag.

  * dbg
    Builds a debugging perl.  Controls the `DEBUGGING` flag.

  * mb
    Builds a perl with 64-bit and long double support.  Controls
    the `usemorebits` flag.

  * shrplib
    Builds a shared libperl used by perl.  Needed for some dynamic loading
    cases.  Controls the `useshrplib` flag.

There are three other special versions that can be requested:

  * system
    Uses the default system perl.  This can be useful if there are perl modules
    you want to install using apt-get.

  * dev
    Installs the latest development perl build available.  This will be
    something like 5.21.8.

  * blead
    Installs perl from git.  This is bleading-edge version of perl, and will
    occationally fail to build at all.  If used, it's usually recommended to
    list in `allow_failures`.


Control Environment Variables
-----------------------------
There are various environment variables that will control how a build is done.

  * `COVERAGE`

    If true, coverage will be reported after running tests.  Coverage results
    will also be submitted to [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/).  If false,
    the `coverage-setup`, `coverage-report`, and `cpan-install --coverage`
    commands will be no-ops.

    Defaults to false.

  * `AUTHOR_TESTING`

    If true, developer prerequisites will be installed by the
    `cpan-install --deps` command, and the `test-dirs` and `test-files`
    commands will include the `xt` directory.  This will also be used by many
    test scripts.

    Defaults to true.

  * `SPLIT_BUILD`

    Controls if the dist should be generated using a separate (more modern)
    perl version.  This is needed if the dist generation process requires a
    newer perl version than is being tested.  It can also help speed up the
    generation process if it has heavy dependencies, such as Dist::Zilla, and
    testing is being done on a freshly built perl.

    Defaults to true.

  * `CPAN_MIRROR`

    The CPAN mirror that dependencies will be installed from.

    Defaults to http://www.cpan.org/.

  * `REBUILD_PERL`

    If set, prebuilt versions of perl will not automatically be downloaded and
    used.

  * `TEST_PARTITION`, `TEST_PARTITIONS`

    If set, `test-files` will divide all of the tests into partitions and
    return the files from one of them.  This can be used to split up long
    testing runs to keep them under the time limits imposed by Travis-CI.

  * `TRAVIS_PERL_DEBUG`
  
    If set, then all the helper scripts will include `set +x`, causing them
    echo all the commands that they run. This can be helpful when trying to
    understand problems with using these helpers.

Example Long .travis.yml
------------------------
The simple `.travis.yml` listed above is roughly equivalent to:

    language: perl
    perl:
      - "5.8"
      - "5.8.4"
      - "5.8.4-thr"
      - "5.12.2"
      - "5.20"
      - "dev"
      - "blead"
    matrix:
      include:
        - perl: 5.18
          env: COVERAGE=1
      allow_failures:
        - perl: "blead"
    sudo: false
    before_install:
      - git clone git://github.com/travis-perl/helpers ~/travis-perl-helpers
      - source ~/travis-perl-helpers/init
      - build-perl
      - perl -V
      - build-dist
      - cd $BUILD_DIR             # $BUILD_DIR is set by the build-dist command
    install:
      - cpan-install --deps       # installs prereqs, including recommends
      - cpan-install --coverage   # installs converage prereqs, if enabled
    before_script:
      - coverage-setup
    script:
      - prove -l -j$(test-jobs) $(test-files)   # parallel testing
    after_success:
      - coverage-report

Using this form rather than `--auto` allows many more parts of the process to be
controlled.

Commands
--------
  * init

    Sets up the helper functions, and initializes environment variables.
    Accepts three options:
      * --perl
        automatically runs the build-perl command for you

      * --auto
        Does as much as possible for you.  Runs build-perl, and uses other
        commands as appropriate to do a full build and test.  If this option is
        used, none of the other build phases should be customized, and none of
        the commands should be used aside from cpan-install.

      * --always-upgrade-modules
        The `cpanm` command will be run without the `--skip-satisfied`
        option. If you are using the Travis caching, you will want to add this
        flag so that your local lib does not get progressively more out of
        date over time.

  * build-perl

    Installs the requested perl version as needed, and switches to it.

  * build-dist

    Builds a dist directory for the module.  Sets the `BUILD_DIR` environment
    variable to the path of the built dist.  If `SPLIT_BUILD` is true, the
    latest preinstalled perl version will used.  If `SPLIT_BUILD` is false, the
    requested perl version will be used instead.

    If a `dist.ini` file exists in the repository, Dist::Zilla will be used to
    generate the dist.  Additional prerequisites will be installed as needed.

    If a `Makefile.PL` file exists, ExtUtils::MakeMaker's distdir command will
    be used.

    If a `Build.PL` file exists, Module::Build's distdir command will be used.

  * cpan-install

    Installs dependencies.  Dependencies can either be listed manually, or
    the --deps flag can be given to install all dependencies of the current
    dist.

    This command accepts the --coverage option.  If the COVERAGE environment
    variable is set, this will attempt to install Devel::Cover and
    Devel::Cover::Report::Coveralls.  If the environment variable is not set,
    does nothing.

    Finally, you can pass --update-prereqs to make this script run without
    passing `--skip-satisfied` to `cpanm`.

  * tests-dirs

    Outputs either "t xt" normally, or just "t" if the AUTHOR_TESTING
    environment variable is set to 0.

  * tests-files

    Outputs all of the test files found in the directories returned from
    `test-dirs`.  If `TEST_PARTITIONS` and `TEST_PARTITION` are set, the tests
    are divided into `TEST_PARTITIONS` equal sized groups, and group
    `TEST_PARTITION` will be returned.

  * test-jobs

    Outputs the recommended number of parallel test runs to use.  This will be
    calculated based on the number of CPUs available.  If `COVERAGE` is true, it
    will be 1, as Devel::Cover does not yet cope well with parallel testing.

  * coverage-setup

    Sets up the environment to record coverage data when running tests.  Does
    nothing if `COVERAGE` is false.

  * coverage-report

    Outputs a coverage report.  If Devel::Cover::Report::Coveralls is
    available, it will send the report to Coveralls.  Does nothing if
    `COVERAGE` is false.

  * local-lib

    Activates a local::lib directory.  Without a parameter, creates a new
    local::lib directory and activates it. This can be valuable if you need to
    isolate the prereqs you are installing from the core modules.  Any parameters
    given are taken as names of [predefined local::libs](share/local-libs.txt) to
    load. For example, `local-lib dzil` can save a lot of time for Dist::Zilla
    based modules.

local::lib
----------
A number of [predefined local::lib](share/local-libs.txt) directories are
available for use.  Pre-built perl versions will also include pre-built
local::lib directories.  If there is no pre-built copy of the local::lib
available, it will be built when requested.

Notes
-----
Travis-CI will attempt to switch to the specified perl version, and report the
output of `perl --version`.  If the perl version specified isn't one of the
prebuilt options, this will result in an error and mismatched version
information.  These can be ignored.  The build will continue, allowing the
`build-perl` command to build and switch to the requested version.  It is
recommended to include `perl -V` after `build-perl`, so the build details of
the perl being used will be included in the build log.
